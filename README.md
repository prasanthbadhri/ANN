Artificial neural network

The term "Artificial Neural Network" is derived from Biological neural networks that develop the structure of a human brain. Similar to the human brain that has neurons interconnected to one another, artificial neural networks also have neurons that are interconnected to one another in various layers of the networks. These neurons are known as nodes.There are around 1000 billion neurons in the human brain. Each neuron has an association point somewhere in the range of 1,000 and 100,000.

Input Layer:
As the name suggests, it accepts inputs in several different formats provided by the programmer.

Hidden Layer:
The hidden layer presents in-between input and output layers. It performs all the calculations to find hidden features and patterns.

Output Layer:
The input goes through a series of transformations using the hidden layer, which finally results in output that is conveyed using this layer.

The artificial neural network takes input and computes the weighted sum of the inputs and includes a bias. This computation is represented in the form of a transfer function.
